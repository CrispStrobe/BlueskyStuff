# Bluesky Guide
Collection of Tips &amp; Tools for collaborating on [Bluesky](https://bsky.app) shared by [Jeftek.com](https://bsky.app/profile/jeftek.com)

# Tips
## Account Security
- **Use a Unique Long Password** -  Be sure to use a unique and long password such as a pass phrase for your account.
  * Think "My Dog has 2 Black Spots On their tail" is better than "BlueWinter24!"
- **Enable MFA for login** -  Currently Bluesky only offers email (You do require MFA on your email right?) based secondary verification when signining in with your main password, which can be enabled in your account settings.  (I hope to see Passkey support once they enable OAUTH.)
  * Settings > Two-factor authentication >  Enable Require email code to log into your account
- **Use Unique App Passwords for 3rd party apps** - When signing into 3rd party apps and services, you can generate an App Password for a specific app.
  * Settings > Advanced > App Passwords
## Custom Domains
Bluesky allows you to set your owned custom domain name as your handle/username, and is a great way to demonstrate your account is associated with your public web presence.
